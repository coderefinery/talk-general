## Typical curriculum: 3 days or 6 half-days

- .emph[Basic and collaborative Git]: Basics, branching, merging, archaeology,
  pull requests, code review, project organization
- .emph[Social coding and open software]: Sharing, open source, licenses
- .emph[Reproducible research]: Organizing projects, sharing data, recording dependencies, environments, and steps
- .emph[Jupyter notebooks]: Deploy a reproducible notebook on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
- .emph[Code documentation]: Versioned documentation, Sphinx, Read the Docs, and GitHub pages
- .emph[Automated testing]: pytest and GitHub Actions
- .emph[Modular code development]: Pure functions, side effects, group discussions

## CodeRefinery and [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)

- Carpentries "teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide"
- No competition but .emph[collaboration]
- We use an .emph[interactive style of teaching], like Carpentries
- Most of CodeRefinery lesson material uses the same "look"
- Target audience are **students and researchers who already write code**
- Intermediate level
- Problem: many students and researchers do not regard themselves as "developers"
- NeIC is Carpentries platinum .emph[member organization]
- All CodeRefinery instructors take .emph[Carpentries instructor training] and are encouraged
  to teach Carpentries workshops
- CodeRefinery project co-funds a .emph[Carpentries coordinator position] Nordics/Baltics

## Scaling up during 2020: effective team work

<img src="img/scaling-up.png" style="width: 50%;"/>

- Lectures & code-along exercises in the main room: .emph[stream and also record]
- Get help and group exercises in a breakout room
- 100 participants, 20+ helpers
- Participants can register as teams ("bring your own breakout room")
- Installation sessions and helper preparation sessions
- [Operation manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/)
- Asynchronous Q&A via [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) ->
  we publish these ([example](https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-10-20-online/#questions-answers-and-feedback))

## Future and challenges

- We are a Nordic project but this is not a Nordic-only problem
- .emph[Funding]
- Better credit for volunteers and in-kind contributions
- Possibly establish a non-profit organization
- Governance model
- Welcoming atmosphere and diversity
